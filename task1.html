<h1>1.1 WHAT IS REQUIRED IN TASK 1    OF THE IELTS WRITING EXAM? </h1>
     <p>The  writing  portion  of  the  IELTS  exam  is  60  minutes  in  length.    The  Academic  and  General portions require the studdent to complete two tasks referred to as Task1 and Task2; however, the tasks themselves differ between the two exams.The first task of the Academic exam asks the student to write a descriptive report based on information gived in a picture, table, diagram or graph. Task 1 of the General exam requires students to write a letter. Task 2 on both exams requires students compose an essay. Essay questions are very similar between the two exams; however, General test takes may be more personal an d less formal in their response. Students are expected to allot 20 minutes to Task 1 and 40 minutes to Task 2 when engaging either exam. </p>
     <p>The  written  Task  1  portion  of  the  Academic  IELTS  is  designed  to  test  your ability to analyze data presented on English and to express this in writing. As these data sources can be quite random, you will need to train yourself to be flexible.   </p>
     <p>into  its  broad,  minor  and  minute  details.    The  student  must  then  be  able to employ sufficiently broad lexical resources to describe these details coherently and with grammatical accuracy. The product of their writing should be cohesive  and logical and read with a fluency almost indiscernible from a native English user.   </p>
     <p>mar.    These  four  sections  tend  to  be  interdependent,  thus  performing  poorly  in  one often lowers grades in others. In the following section, we will briefly discuss each of these categories and how a student can fulfill them.  </p>
     <h2><em>Task achievement</em> </h2>
     <p>This breadth gauges the depth with which the student is able to reflect the information presented in their data source. Often a good test of whether the student has done this to check if an accurate reproduction of the original data source could be made based on the student's writing. The other breadth (Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resources and Grammar) are very closely tied to the student's Task achievement mark. Coherence issues, for example, leave the Task Achievement requirements unfulfilled.</p>
     <h2>Coherence and Cohesion </h2>
     <p>This section of the mark gauges the student's ability to write in a way that expresses a message fluently. Sentence structure, fitting vocabulary choices and grammar contribute to how coherent a student's message is. Cohesive phrases help tie ideas together at the sentence and paragraph level and solidify the overall fluency with which the report can be read.    </p>
     <h2><em>Lexical Resources</em></h2>
     <p>This area refers to the accuracy and relevance of the vocabulary a student chooses to employ when describing their data source. Successful students exhibit the ability to use a variety of contextually accurate words and phrases without sounding unnatural or robotic. Word variation accuracy is also a defining trait of a successful student performing at this level.   </p>
     <h2><em>Grammar</em></h2>
     <p>Grammar is often the area that holds students back from the upper IELTS bands. Students scoring band 7 and above are capable of composing grammatically accurate sentences at least 50% of the time. Grammar issues tend to have  a cascading effect on student performance in other sections, too. For example, poor grammar can hinder an examiner's ability to understand what the student is writing, which directly impacts the student's Coherence mark. Poor coherence in turn lowers the student's overall Task Achievement performance.     </p>
